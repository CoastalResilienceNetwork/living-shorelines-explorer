In these settings, a low-profile sill parallel to shore provides an initial wave break, allowing the marsh vegetation to grow, further reducing waves and trap sediment.  This living shoreline type is recommended where wave energy is moderate and/or natural marsh does not occur within 100 meters of the proposed site."

The model was adjusted for a 1 m tidal range, and WEMo was run using the top 20% of hourly wind data from Cape Lookout (NDBC station CLKN7) spanning the period 2012-2015.  Threshold values for shoreline wind-wave energy calculated by WEMo were based upon previous analysis of RWE values along stable natural marsh shorelines, oyster fringed shorelines and sill based living shorelines."

There are two primary types of boat channels in the study region:<br><br>1) the Atlantic Intracoastal Water Way, frequented by large commercial vessels that create large waves that travel far before dissipating, and <br>2) channels that are too small to accommodate large vessels, or recreational boating channels.<br><br>Based on previous scientific studies of boat wake impacts on shorelines, two categories of distance criteria were identified.  Each shoreline point was scored on proximity to the nearest recreational channel and proximity to the Atlantic Intracoastal Water Way and the lowest of those two scores was used as the boat wake factor score for that site."
