The impact of boat wakes on shorelines was weighted as a function of the proximity of the shoreline point to marked navigation channels.  There are two primary types of boat channels in the study region:<br><br>1) the Atlantic Intracoastal Water Way, frequented by large commercial vessels that create large waves that travel far before dissipating, and <br>2) channels that are too small to accommodate large vessels, or recreational boating channels.<br><br>Based on previous scientific studies of boat wake impacts on shorelines, two categories of distance criteria were identified.  Each shoreline point was scored on proximity to the nearest recreational channel and proximity to the Atlantic Intracoastal Water Way and the lowest of those two scores was used as the boat wake factor score for that site."

These individual variables are assigned a risk value and then combined via a simple spatial computation to reveal an overall erosion and inundation vulnerability. High-risk shorelines have one, or a combination, of the following characteristics: high exposure to wind waves or boat activity, steep and high marsh platform, short or non-existent vegetation, narrow vegetation buffers, high storm surge impacts and rate of sea level rise."
